SERA

This is a faculty assessement software which utilizes microsoft graph api, node.js,
mongoDB, handles-bars, and javascript in order to derive data from the Outlook email
service that can be used to assess faculty performance. The data used by SERA, will
be obtained by using the graph api and will be logged into a database for future
report generation. This software allows the user to generate reports that summarize
their performance in terms of email responsiveness. These reports can then be used
to plan accordingly and to improve faculty/student communication.
